Write a Bank Charges program

The program asks for the beginning balance and the number of checks written. Compute and display the banks's service fees for the month.

Requirements:

A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial checking account:
$1 each for fewer than 10 checks
$.75 each for 10-29 checks
$.50 each for 30-49 checks
$.25 each for 50 or more checks
The bank also charges an extra $25 if the balance of the account falls below $500 (before any check fees are applied).
Use validation for the input. Do no accept a negative value for the number of checks written. If a negative value is given for the beginning balance, display an urgent message indicating the account is overdrawn.
Use of function in your program (see Chapter 6)
Use "iomanip"  to format the output and $ for amount.  I would like to see the details output, like the receipt.
